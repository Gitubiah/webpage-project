         <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><strong>Crochet</strong> is the process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn, thread, or strands of other materials.<br> The name is derived from the French term <em>croc</em>, which means 'hook'. Hooks can be made from a variety of materials, such as metal, wood, bamboo,or plastic.</p>

                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>Although knitting has been dated since the 11<sup>th</sup> century CE,crochet is said to have been developed around the 15-17<sup>th</sup> century.There is early evidence that the Chinese were making dolls using crochet techniques. It's called Amigurumi. Also, through old techniques such as tambouring as you can visualize today as needlepoint where the fabric is stretched so you can insert a needle through the fabric to pull up a loop. It's said that the chain stitch was achieved which may have been responsible for thinking what can thread do if it's looped without going through a fabric first.
                    <br>
                    <br>Crochet at one time was made for other pieces, maybe a collar for a top or even expanding into full-size projects such as table cloths. It was detailed and very intricate. It was a skill learned and trading existed to help families have work. It wasn't uncommon that men and women were involved in the early stages of crochet.</p>
