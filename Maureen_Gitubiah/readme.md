# 1. Multimedia Elements Used and The Impact On The User

I decided to use elements such as headings <h1>-<h6> to let the user know about the different headings in the webpage. At the <header> the user will know what the webpage is all about in my case the header contains the first heading <h1> of my web page which is "The craft of Crochet" this will let the user know that the webpage is all about a craft known as crochet. It also contains the navigation <nav> bar which will allow users to navigate through different parts of my webpage.

The <section> element divided the content into different sections through which the user will read and understand separately. I have added a video to enable users to have a visual demonstration of what the first section is all about, the audio will enable users to listen to the explanation of the second section of the webpage either while scrolling or after they have read it and images to enable them identify the items listed in the webpage.

# 2. Challenges Faced When Embedding External Content

Embedding the Youtube tutorial into the webpage resulted to an error on the w3c validator even though i pressed on embed part on the share part on Youtube.
